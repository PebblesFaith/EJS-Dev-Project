# EJS-Dev-Project

Dated March 14, 2023

Dear concerned authorities,

I am writing this grievance to bring to your attention a matter of grave concern regarding my public safety. As a citizen of this great nation, I have always upheld the principles of equality and freedom for all. However, I regret to inform you that I have been a victim of discrimination, abuse and harassment by an unknown person who goes by a fictitious name similar to mine

This person has intentionally and willfully participated in a habitual dislike against me based on my color, hair, sexual orientation, American nationality, disability, female birth sex, and gender identity have caused me extremely significant harm and distress. I have been subjected to constant verbal abuse, derogatory remarks, and insults because I have refused to conform to the public and neigbhors' psychological perceptions of who I ought to be.

I have always been proud of who I am, and I have never let anyone dictate to me, how I should live my life. However, I am now facing economic and disproportionate consequences due to the negligent, false, and misrepresentative statements made about me by people who do not know me well enough to jump to their psychological perceptions or conclusions.

This discrimination has not only affected my personal life but has also impacted my professional career making it difficult for me to find employment and make a living, as well as, educational attainments, and housing because of the public habitual dislike of me.

Despite my refusal to conform to their narrow and damaging perceptions of who I should be, they continue to spread false and misrepresentative statements about me, which have had a disproportionately negative impact on my economic and social well-being.

Moreover, these individuals have placed me under a compulsory condition of servitude by pretending that I am always someone else, specifically the fictitious name person. This has further compounded the harm that I have suffered at their hands, as it has made it extremely difficult for me to assert my identity and defend myself against their attacks.

I urge you to take immediate action to ensure my safety and well-being, as well as the safety of others who may be similarly affected by this individual and their associates. Specifically, I would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate measures to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. I also request that you take steps to prevent further harm from occurring, including providing me with any necessary support and protection.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

Sarai Hannah Ajai

After, Sarai Hannah Ajai had made her necessary JavaScript codes language changes corrections from her yesterday (March 10, 2023) JavaScript codes language errors she had experienced today (March 11, 2023) computer hacker[s] had intentionally, knowingly, and willfully added these lines of codes are as follows:

app.use('/login', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('middleware called!');
    // Check if user is Already authenticated
    if (!req.session.isAuthenticated) {  
      
        // User of '/login' URL
        req.isUnauthenticated = true;
    }
    next();
}); 

when she had already written the above line of codes causing her index.js (server) file to execute within the Visual Studio Code ("VSC") twice  for which, had shown up onto her VSC terminal twice, as a console.log messages. And, those duplication within her index.js (server) 'app.use('/login', req, res, next)=>' function when executing twice within her NPM's  EJS-Dev-Project had caused her 'app.use('/login', req, res, next)=>' function to execute an error within the Passport that passes through the Session then the computer hacker[s] had deleted his/her added 'app.use('/login', req, res, next)=>' function. Until, Ms. Ajai had performed a 'Middleware' search; in order to review how many times she had console.log('middleware called!) to which had shown only once. Please keep in mind, Ms. Ajai is the only person working on her NPM's EJS-Dev-Project alone, and she does not share her VSC browser with anyone person. Therefore, how could this happen to her without her legal authorities. The attached PNG file is her proof and evidence of her computer hacking experiences.

In the get route of the Express Passport is always established by ways of the ‘req.authenticate’ method within the request and response function which will authenticate the user sent request within the login session. And, by default, when the user login authentication succeeds then the user request property (data information is sent to the SQLites3 database) such as, the user’s email address and password is set through the login session is established. For example, in the example below:

app.get('/signup', (req, res) => {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        res.render('signup');
    } else {
        res.render('error404');
    }
});

In the Passport ‘req.authenticate’ must always be set up to the ‘app.get(‘/signup’, (req, res) =>’ because the user input data information must pass through the login session from the user internet browser assigned cookie; in order to establish authentication rights that passes the user’s data information through the login session into the SQLite3 database. Therefore, Sarai Hannah Ajai must always use the ‘req.isAuthenticated()’ method in order to establish, the user login session then the user’s data information is pass through the login session from the Passport database route ‘app.get(‘/signup’, (req, res) =>’. However, Ms. Ajai is experiencing Passport library ‘req.isAuthenticated()’ problems from her install passport library into her Node Packaging Manager (“NPM”) project name, EJS-DEV-Project. After, she had properly used the ‘req.isAuthenticated()’ methods for the ‘app.get(‘/signup’, (req, res) =>’ and ‘app.get(‘/login’, (req, res) =>’ function routes it appears someone is changing the ‘req.isAuthenticated’ method to the ‘req.isunauthenticated()’ method within the API Passport Library causing Ms. Ajai to experience route reversal after, she enter her route names in the URL bar. So, if you want to test her NPM project name, EJS-DEV-Project than you might have to switch the req.isAuthenticated() method to req.isunauthenticated() method, as the reverse JavaScript programmatic code language logic; in order to get the routes, URL to work properly because someone is tampering with the API Passport Library  ‘req.isAuthenticated()’ for which Ms. Ajai had no control over.
